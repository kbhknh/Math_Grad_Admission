* List honors, fellowships, non-academic distinctions or publications. **700 characters**
* Stanford University regards the diversity of its graduate student body as an important factor in serving the educational mission of the university. We encourage you to share unique, personally important, and/or challenging factors in your background, such as work and life experiences, special interests, culture, socioeconomic status, the quality of your early educational environment, gender, sexual orientation, race or ethnicity. Please discuss how such factors would contribute to the diversity of the entering class, and hence to the experience of your Stanford classmates. **700 characters**

## Fellowship Opportunities
Students in the PhD program who make satisfactory progress are fully funded for five years. Funding sources include department fellowships, teaching assistantships and research assistantships.

In addition, applicants are encouraged to apply for fellowships outside the department. See below for some of the opportunities available, including some of the fellowships received by our students in recent years.

#### Knight-Hennessy Scholars
> Knight-Hennessy Scholars is designed to build a multidisciplinary community of Stanford graduate students dedicated to finding creative solutions to the world’s greatest challenges. The program awards up to 100 high-achieving students every year with full funding to pursue a graduate education at Stanford, including the PhD in Mathematics. To be considered, you must apply to Knight-Hennessy Scholars by September 12, 2018, and separately apply to the Mathematics department by November 14, 2018.

#### China Scholarship Council-Stanford-AZ Fund Fellowship
> Doctoral applicants from China are also encouraged to apply for a China Scholarship Council-Stanford-AZ Fund Fellowship following their admission to the PhD program in Mathematics. This Fellowship provides five years of financial support, round-trip international airfare, and visa application fees to selected students. To be considered, applicants must first be admitted to the Mathematics PhD program and then apply to the China Scholarship Council.

#### National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship
> The National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) Fellowships are awarded to applicants who will pursue a doctoral degree in, or closely related to, an area of DoD interest within fifteen disciplines including mathematics.

#### Hertz Graduate Fellowship Award
> The Hertz Graduate Fellowship Award supports graduate students working towards the Ph.D. degree in the applied physical, biological and engineering sciences including mathematics.

#### NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program
> The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program recognizes and supports outstanding graduate students in NSF-supported science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines who are pursuing research-based Master’s and doctoral degrees at accredited United States institutions.

#### Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada Scholarships
> Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Scholarships provide financial support for studies in a master’s or doctoral program.

#### Fonds de recherche du Québec – Nature et technologies
