* [Harvard Mathematics Department Admission Info](http://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/index.html#admission)

#### Application Deadline:  December 15, 2018

### Preparing the Application
The **statement of purpose** for graduate applications is carefully weighted by the admissions committee. The applicant's statement should convince the committee that he or she is able to communicate effectively and with a deep understanding of mathematics. It is not intended to be a biographical sketch or a reflection on one's decision to enter the field.

Three **letters of recommendation** are required. Letter writers should be faculty or others qualified to evaluate the applicant's potential for graduate study in mathematics. The letters must be submitted online and by the application deadline.

Applicants should include any **research papers, publications, and other original works** they would like to have evaluated by the admissions committee.

The department requires all applicants to submit **GRE Mathematics Subject Test** scores. Applicants should check on the ETS website for test dates in their area to insure the scores will be submitted before the application deadline. While the admissions committee reviews all applications submitted before the deadline, missing math subject test scores provide one less data point available to evaluate the application. Depending on the applicant pool and the strength of the application materials, the missing subject test scores may put the application at a disadvantage. 

The Graduate School requires scores to be submitted for the General Test of the Graduate Record Examinations (**GRE**).

Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold the equivalent of a US Bachelor degree from an institution at which English is the language of instruction must submit scores from the Internet Based Test (IBT) of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (**TOEFL**).

The Graduate School requires applicants to upload an electronic copy of undergraduate **transcripts**. Hard copies of official transcripts are not required at the time of application.

#### Personal Statement

_The Personal History Statement is required from all applicants. Please note that the Personal History Statement should not duplicate the Statement of Purpose._

Please describe how your personal background and experiences influenced your decision to pursue a graduate degree. In this section, you may also include any relevant information on the following:
* How you have overcome barriers to access higher education
* How you have come to understand the barriers faced by others
* Your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education
* Your research focusing on under served populations or related issues of inequality
* Your leadership among such groups
  
[Admission info site Help:](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/personal-statement/ "link")

* What does this statement need to accomplish?
	>The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community, giving the committee an image of you as a person.
	This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your understanding of the experiences of groups historically under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase participation by a diverse population in higher education.

* What kinds of content belongs here?
	>Anything that can give reviewers a sense of you as a person belongs here; you can repeat information about your experiences in your research statement, but any experiences that show your promise, initiative, and ability to persevere despite obstacles belongs here. This is also a good place to display your communication skills and discuss your ability to maximize effective collaboration with a diverse cross-section of the academic community. If you have faced any obstacles or barriers in your education, sharing those experiences serves both for the selection process, and for your nomination for fellowships. If one part of your academic record is not ideal, due to challenges you faced in that particular area, this is where you can explain that, and direct reviewers’ attention to the evidence of your promise for higher education.

* The basic message: your academic achievement despite challenges
	>It is especially helpful for admissions committees considering nominating you for fellowships for diversity if you discuss any or all of the following:

	* Demonstrated significant academic achievement by overcoming barriers such as economic, social, or educational disadvantage;
	* Potential to contribute to higher education through understanding the barriers facing women, domestic minorities, students with disabilities, and other members of groups underrepresented in higher education careers, as evidenced by life experiences and educational background. For example,,
		* attendance at a minority serving institution;
		* ability to articulate the barriers facing women and minorities in science and engineering fields;
		* participation in higher education pipeline programs such as, UC Leads, or McNair Scholars;
	* Academic service advancing equitable access to higher education for women and racial minorities in fields where they are underrepresented;
	* Leadership experience among students from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education;
	* Research interests focusing on underserved populations and understanding issues of racial or gender inequalities. For example,
		* research that addresses issues such as race, gender, diversity, and inclusion;
		* research that addresses health disparities, educational access and achievement, political engagement, economic justice, social mobility, civil and human rights, and other questions of interest to historically underrepresented groups;
		* artistic expression and cultural production that reflects culturally diverse communities or voices not well represented in the arts and humanities.

#### [Statement of Purpose](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/statement-purpose/ "link")

_Please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization, including your preparation for this field of study, your academic plans or research interests, and your future career goals. Please be specific about why UC Berkeley would be a good intellectual fit for you._


* Part 1: Introduce yourself, your interests and motivations
	* Tell them what you’re interested in, and perhaps, what sparked your desire for graduate study. This should be short and to the point; don’t spend a great deal of time on autobiography.



* Part 2: Summarize your undergraduate and previous graduate career
	* Research you conducted. Indicate with whom, the title of the project, what your responsibilities were, and the outcome. Write technically, or in the style of your discipline. Professors are the people who read these statements.
	* Important paper or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your curricular requirements.
	* Work experience, especially if you had any kind of responsibility for testing, designing, researching or interning in an area similar to what you wish to study in graduate school.



* Part 3: Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities
	* If you graduated and worked prior to returning to grad school, indicate what you’ve been doing: company or non-profit, your work/design team, responsibilities, what you learned. You can also indicate here how this helped you focus your graduate studies.
	

* Part 4: Elaborate on your academic interests
	* Here you indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in their discipline, and are engaged with current research themes.
		* Indicate the area of your interests. Ideally, pose a question, define a problem, or indicate a theme that you would like to address, and questions that arise from contemporary research. This should be an ample paragraph!
		* Look on the web for information about departments you’re interested in, including professors and their research. Are there professors whose research interests parallel yours? If so, indicate this. Check the specific program; many may require you to name a professor or professors with whom you might work.
		* End your statement in a positive manner, indicating your excitement and readiness for the challenges ahead of you.
		

* Essential Tips
	* What the admissions committee will read between the lines: self-motivation, competence, potential as a graduate student.
	* Emphasize everything from a positive perspective and write in an active, not a passive voice.
	* Demonstrate everything by example; don’t say directly that you’re a persistent person, show it.
	* If there is something important that happened to you that affected your grades, such as poverty, illness, or excessive work, state it. Write it affirmatively, showing your perseverance despite obstacles. You can elaborate more in your personal statement.
	* Make sure everything is linked with continuity and focus.
	* Unless the specific program says otherwise, be concise; an ideal essay should say everything it needs to with brevity. Approximately 500 to 1000 well-selected words (1-2 single space pages in 12 point font) is better than more words with less clarity and poor organization.

Departments may require additional information, so please check their listings. In general, though, applicants are responsible for submitting the following: 

#### Personal Statement 
All applicants are required to submit a personal statement regarding their interests and/or intended areas of study. Some programs ask applicants to address specific questions in their personal statements. Please review the listings for the Ph.D. or master’s program in which you are interested for details. 

#### Transcripts 
We strongly encourage applicants to submit a scanned image of the transcript at the time of application, which can speed processing; however, a final, official transcript will be required of all admitted students who matriculate. Applicants who have attended international institutions must submit transcripts or certified attestations of study, with certified English translations. Once translated, the original transcript and the certified translations are to be sent to the Graduate School admission office. College seniors should submit current transcripts, followed by a final official transcript showing the award of the baccalaureate degree prior to matriculation, as is required and mentioned above. 

#### Letters of Recommendation 
The Graduate School requires **three** letters of recommendation by persons well qualified to speak from first-hand knowledge about the applicant's potential for graduate study. All letters should comment on an applicant’s ability to do research and perform in the program’s required coursework. At least two of these letters should be from faculty at the institution of current study or, if the applicant is not in school at the time of application, at the institution most recently attended. Letters of recommendation for applicants to master’s programs may be from academic or non-academic sources; please consult individual program listings for details. Letters of recommendation must be submitted online. If you are using Interfolio please refer to their website for instructions on submitting your recommendations electronically.

#### GRE 
Applicants to doctoral programs must have their results from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test sent to the Graduate School or, if applying to one of the programs in the School of Public Health, to a separate Brown University code.

Please refer to our [GRE page](https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/application-information/gre-information) and individual listings for the Ph.D. or master’s program in which you are interested for details. 

#### TOEFL/IELTS 
All international applicants whose native language is not English must ensure that the Graduate School receives their official score from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS).

Regarding TOEFL, the recommended minimum score for admission consideration is 577 on the paper-based test and **90** on the Internet-based test. For IELTS, the recommended minimum overall band score is 7. Some programs may have more rigorous language proficiency standards; applicants with questions should contact programs directly. These exams should be taken early enough to allow the scores to reach the Graduate School by your program's deadline. Performance on the tests is one of many factors considered in making admission decisions. 

Official TOEFL scores should be sent to Brown University Graduate School (reporting code **3094**). Those applying to School of Public Health programs should have the scores sent to both the Graduate School and SOPHAS (reporting code  5688).

Students who have been awarded teaching assistantships and whose native language is not English will be tested upon their arrival for English proficiency before they begin teaching. If a student's English language skills do not meet the minimum standards of certification, provisional approval of the appointment may be made on the condition that the student enroll in an English-language training course during the first semester of the appointment and be assigned to other duties that will prepare them for teaching. 

NOTE: Students who have not been certified at the appropriate level for the classroom or laboratory will not be supported as teaching assistants past the first year.

#### Application Fee and Waivers
A non-refundable fee of $75 is charged for processing each application received by the Graduate School. This fee must be paid when the application is submitted. An application will not be processed unless the fee is paid. Applicants who want to be evaluated by more than one graduate program must submit separate applications to each program for which they would like to be considered. The Graduate School is not responsible for errors made by applicants during the application process. There are no application-fee refunds. Application-fee waivers are available under certain circumstances. Applicants to Brown's graduate programs who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and can demonstrate financial need may apply for an application-fee waiver. Please note: application-fee waivers are not available for international applicants. Please see this page for detailed information about application-fee waivers.

#### Paper Credentials and Other Documentation
All materials related to an application that are not submitted electronically as part of the online application should be mailed to the Graduate School admission office: 47 George St., Box 1867, Brown University, Providence, R.I. 02912. Do not send any application materials directly to the program you are applying to as this will only slow the progress of your application. Material submitted in support of the application, including transcripts and writing samples, will not be returned to the applicant. 

#### Criteria for Admission
Admission to the Graduate School is determined at the program level with oversight by the Graduate School. Each program, in consultation with the dean of the Graduate School, sets its own admission criteria. The individual academic programs evaluate applications for admission. Admission decisions are made after a full review of the materials in the application. Programs consider previous records, test scores, and recommendations and look for clear evidence of the ability to do advanced work of the highest quality. The admission decisions are final. There is no appeals process.

#### Notification
Applicants should expect to be notified within four to eight weeks of the application deadline for their programs (February or March for a January 1 deadline). Whether or not applications that are submitted after a program's stated deadline will be reviewed is at the discretion of each program. While individual academic programs evaluate applicants for admission, offers of admission are only binding when made in writing by the Dean of the Graduate School. Admission may, in some cases, be deferred; aid offers cannot be deferred.

* [Mathematics Admission](https://www.ma.utexas.edu/academics/graduate/admissions)

### Applications(Mathematics)

The Math Department accepts students interested in pursuing a PhD in pure or applied mathematics, and students interested in a Master's degree in actuarial science.  All students admitted to the PhD program are offered financial support.

The department is committed to preparing leaders in fields that are becoming increasingly diverse. We believe that our students benefit from participation in a culture of diversity. The department encourages applications from individuals within populations traditionally underrepresented math. Our goal is to provide all our students with an inclusive and supportive environment in which they can reach their greatest intellectual potential.

Admission to the Math Department is highly competitive. In recent years, we have seen almost 400 students per year apply to be among an incoming class of usually no more than twenty students.

The Department's Graduate Admissions Committee will consider the following factors in arriving at its decision concerning the admission of an applicant:

* Undergraduate academic record, especially performance in upper-division, conceptually oriented mathematics classes;
* Performance in prior graduate mathematics courses (if applicable);
* Letters of recommendation;
* The contents of the personal statement, especially as they relate to the intellectual preparedness of the applicant to undertake graduate studies in mathematics or to special circumstances in an applicant's background that might indicate the potential for success in a graduate mathematics program;
* Undergraduate research experience;
* Performance on the GRE (general and subject); and
* Performance on the TOEFL (if applicable).

To be competitive, a candidate usually needs a program of coursework like the following (this is only a guideline; and it is possible, particularly for students in applied mathematics, to be competitive with more varied backgrounds):

* A standard set of introductory undergraduate courses would include the calculus sequence, linear algebra, and differential equations.
* A solid set of advanced undergraduate courses would include two semesters of proof-based analysis, two semesters of proof-based abstract algebra, and at least one of topology.
* A variety of other classes, like complex analysis or probability or differential geometry help with breadth.
The best predictor of success in any graduate program is success in one or more introductory graduate courses.

If you are accepted for admission to our graduate program, you will automatically be considered for financial assistance; so no separate application for financial assistance is required.

In special circumstances, we also consider students applying for admission without financial support from us. If you do not need financial assistance because you expect  external funding from another source, and would like to be considered for admission without support, you should indicate this clearly in your statement  of purpose, including the source and amount of funding you expect to receive. Applicants claiming external support should not in general expect to be offered financial assistance by the math department, and may be asked to provide proof of external funding before admissions decisions are made.

### HOW TO APPLY

Applicants must submit the official online application, official transcripts, test scores, and processing fees to the Graduate and International Admissions Center. Please visit the GIAC website for specific and detailed instructions regarding the application process. After reviewing GIAC and Math Department instructions on how to apply, please complete the ApplyTexas online application. 

Regarding transcripts sent to GIAC:

You will upload a scan of your official transcript(s) after you have submitted your application for admission and paid the application fee. After you have submitted your application you will receive an email that contains a link to the Status Check web page where you will be able to upload your transcript.   

Please do not mail official transcripts to GIAC or to the Math Department. When a student is admitted to our program, **GIAC will ask that official paper transcripts be mailed or delivered in person**. 

The following items are also required by the Math Department :

* **General GRE and Subject GRE** - The Mathematics Subject GRE score must be submitted along with the General test score.  Official scores are reported directly to UT Austin (GIAC) when you select our University code.  Applications received without the Mathematics Subject GRE score will be accepted, but we cannot guarantee that they will receive equal consideration. GRE Subject scores are also expected for applicants to the Master's program in Actuarial Science. If your official scores are only available after the December 15 deadline, we recommend you obtain your scores on the ETS website and self report these in a separate document. Please title this document “General GRE and/or Subject GRE Scores”, and upload it as a “miscellaneous document” via your Status Check page. For more information on test scores, please see this page: [https://gradschool.utexas.edu/how-to-apply](https://gradschool.utexas.edu/how-to-apply)

* **Statement of purpose** - 1-2 pages describing your research area of interest, listing any publications, and descriptions of previous or current research work. If you maintain a personal website or mathematics blog and you would like to share this with us, please include the URL in this document. This can be submitted via your Status Check page after submission of the ApplyTexas form.

* **Three letters of recommendation** - must be submitted via the UT Austin recommendation system. 

* **Resume** - include any awards, honors or other important items you wish to highlight. This can be submitted via your Status Check page after submission of the ApplyTexas form.

* **Other Documents** - Although not required, applicants are strongly encouraged to submit samples of your publications, thesis, research notes, etc. to support your application Please submit these items as a “miscellaneous document” via your Status Check page.

* **TOEFL** - (International students only) Please submit per the instructions above for the GRE. IELTS scores may not be substituted for TOEFL scores. If you have not yet received your official test results, self-report your test score(s) in a separate document and title this as “TOEFL Scores”, and upload as a “miscellaneous document” via your Status Check page. 

After you have submitted the ApplyTexas application, it will take approximately one to two business days to load into UT's system.   When GIAC receives your application you will receive an email with your UT EID and password.  Your UT EID is an identifier that UT Austin uses for applicants and students.  Do not create an additional UT EID.  You must use the one assigned to you after you submit your application.  If you are a previous or current student of UT Austin, you should use your existing UT EID.

* [General Admission Information](https://gradschool.duke.edu/admissions)
* [How to apply - Mathematics](https://math.duke.edu/graduate/apply)

### Application Instructions(Mathematics)

To be considered for Fall admission you MUST submit your application by **December 19**. GRE and TOEFL test results, and letters of recommendation can come in after December 19 but must arrive before we begin to review applications in early January.

The list of application materials required by the Duke Graduate School can be found on their Admissions website. For an application to be considered complete, the Graduate School requires ALL of the following:

* A completed Duke Graduate School electronic application for admission
* The application fee ($85 USD payable by credit card)
* Three (3) or more letters of recommendation. The graduate school strongly discourages the submission of more than 3 letters, but the math department does not care if you submit more.
* Transcripts from all undergraduate institutions you attended, including any exchange student study. (NOTE: You can send in unofficial transcripts with your application, but if accepted you will need to supply official transcripts.)
* Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores – the general test is required. The mathematics subject is strongly recommended. Almost all of the applicants we accept will have a subject test score above 50%. (NOTE: GRE scores cannot be more than 5 years old.)
* For international students, TOEFL exams scores. (see Duke's [English language proficiency requirements](https://gradschool.duke.edu/admissions/apply/english-language-proficiency-test-scores)). The math department only admits students with **a TOEFL of 100 or more, and a speaking score of at least 20**. TOEFL scores can only be 2 years old at the time the application is submitted. We prefer TOEFL exams but we will accept IELTS scores. To be admitted the score should be 7.5 or higher.

To be eligible for a TOEFL waiver, you must have studied full time for two years or more at a college or university where the sole language of instruction is English and in a country where English is the primary spoken language. The two years of study must be completed prior to application submission.
Application materials must be sent directly to the Duke Graduate School.

Once the application has been uploaded you can no longer revise it. For example it is not possible to upload updated transcripts that show grades from the Fall semester (or quarter). Of course, letters of recommendation will be added as they arrive.

#### Transcripts

Do not mail paper copies of your transcripts before receiving an offer of admission. If you are unable to upload your transcripts to the application because your educational institution does not issue transcripts directly to students, please follow the instructions at the end of this page.

If you are admitted, you will be asked to request an official transcript from each institution listed in the Education section of your application, regardless of the number of credits earned. (You will not have to provide separate official transcripts from study abroad institutions, as long as the study abroad credits are listed on the official transcript from your home educational institution.)

Duke reserves the right to rescind any offer of admission if any discrepancies are found between your uploaded and official transcripts.

**Upload electronic copies of your unofficial transcripts via the online application**. Do not submit secondary-school records.

Each transcript must provide a year-by-year listing of all courses taken and the grade or mark received for each. 
* The transcript must list your name and the name of the school.
* If your school provides transcripts in English, please provide the English-language transcript. If your school does not provide transcripts in English, you must provide a transcript in the original language AND an English translation from a professional translation service.
* If your Social Security number appears on your transcripts, mark out all except the last four digits of the number before uploading the transcripts to your application.
* If the grading scale of the institution is available, be sure to include that information.
* Before uploading an electronic transcript issued by your school, make sure it can be opened without passwords or other security information.
* We do not accept web page screenshots from a student information system in place of transcripts. Uploading screenshots instead of transcripts will delay the processing of your application.
* You may submit a credential evaluation from a third party (e.g. WES or ECE), but if you do so, you must also submit the transcript from your institution.

#### Letters of Recommendations

The Graduate School requires three recommendation letters in support of your application. Your recommenders must submit their letters of recommendation electronically via the online recommendation system.  

We strongly discourage requesting more than three recommendations unless you are asked to do so by the department to which you are applying. Rather than improving your chances of admission, an excessive number of recommendation letters may actually cause application reviewers to view your file unfavorably.

Should you receive and accept an offer of admission, your recommenders may be asked to verify their authorship of the submitted recommendation letters.

In the Recommendations section of the online application, enter the contact information of your recommenders, including their e-mail addresses. Each recommender will then receive an e-mail that includes a link to an online recommendation form. This is the form the recommender will use to upload a letter in support of your application.

The Graduate School accepts recommendations from the Interfolio letter service and other letter services that are compatible with our online recommendation system. If you are using a letter service, enter the recommender’s name in the recommendation section of the application and enter the e-mail address provided by the letter service.

#### Statement of Purpose

As part of your online application, you must upload a statement of purpose. The statement should be one to two pages and single spaced. It should briefly discuss

* your purposes and objectives in pursuing graduate study;
* your special interests and plans;
* your strengths and weaknesses in your chosen field;
* any research projects or any independent research in which you have actively participated and how they have influenced your career choice and desire to pursue graduate studies; and
* any particular reasons you may have for applying to Duke (e.g. you would like to work with a specific faculty member).

#### Resume

As part of your online application, you must upload a resume or curriculum vitae (CV). This document should summarize your education, academic achievements, work history, and professional accomplishments. It may also include a list of skills, publications, research experiences, and other credentials that demonstrate your preparedness for graduate study.

#### Deadlines
The deadline for submission of applications is **December 31st**, in the case of applications that request financial support. If some of the material related to the application (letters of recommendation or score on the GRE or TOEFL) is received **a few weeks later**, the application can still be considered. But since the Admissions Committee reads the files during January, and then meets near the **end of January**, material must arrive by then in order to be considered during the admission process.

If supplementary application materials are submitted after January 1 (whether or not financial support is being requested), a follow-up email message should be sent to the Mathematics Department's Graduate Group Chair, indicating what has been submitted. This includes letters of recommendation.

### Application Requirements
Applicants should check that their applications are complete and correct before submitting them, since the online system does not allow changes to be made after that. Complete applications contain the following items:

* Application form
* Transcripts (can be unofficial at this stage)
* Statement of purpose
* CV/resume
* Letters of recommendation (at least 3, at most 5)

The application form consists of these sections:

* Personal information
* Program information
* Academic background
* Standardized tests
* Additional information

No additional writing sample is needed in the application.

Applicants should submit scores for the **GRE math** subject test and the **TOEFL** (unless exempt from that). Scores on the **basic GRE** test are also requested. Exemptions from the TOEFL are granted to applicants whose native language is English; to those who did their entire undergraduate studies in the United States or Canada; and to those whose spoken English skills have been adequately demonstrated to our admissions committee.

Transcripts are uploaded to the Academic Background section, after entering the other requested information there. The transcript can be unofficial. Those applicants who are admitted will be required to submit an official transcript prior to matriculating in the Penn Math Graduate Program.

If necessary, additional materials can be sent by email to the Mathematics Department's Graduate Coordinator, Reshma Tanna.

### Application and Admission process
* In order to submit an on-line application, it is necessary to **list at least three people** (generally mathematics professors) as writers of letters of recommendation. Once your application is submitted, you cannot arrange for any additional letter writers (beyond those you listed in your application) to upload letters directly to the online system. Instead, if you wish to get additional letters beyond those you indicated on your application, you can ask the additional letter writers to email their letters to the Mathematics Graduate Coordinator, Reshma Tanna. In their message they should state that this letter is for your application to the Mathematics Graduate Program and that the letter should be uploaded to your application.

* Admissions decisions are made by the Mathematics Graduate Admissions Committee, and not by individual professors. Therefore, requests for admission should not be sent to individual members of the faculty, and instead should be submitted as indicated above. Nevertheless, applicants may wish to contact specific professors with whom they may have a particular interest in working, in order to discuss the possibility of applying and in doing research in their area (but should not send mass emails to professors).

* Applicants cannot be considered for possible admission (and no admission decision can be made) until an official online application form is submitted by the applicant and is received by the Mathematics Graduate Admissions Committee.

* Applicants may wish to visit the Penn Math Department in person, to get a better sense of the department and the graduate program. Such visits can be helpful to applicants in deciding where to apply and what offers to accept (but are not part of the Admissions Committee's decision process).

* Those who are admitted will be notified by **email** and **letter**. Those who are rejected will have their status indicated on the online application **website**. While some decisions will be made in February or early March, others will not be made until close to the uniform reply date of April 15, since our admissions committee must wait for replies from those admitted in the first round before being able to make offers to those on our waitlist.

#### Deadlines
The deadline to submit your application for Fall admission is **December 15th**.

The deadline to submit all supporting application materials for Fall admission is **January 1st**.

* [online application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/)

### Admission Requirements
Typically we expect:

* **Transcripts** or academic records from each institution attended. Transcripts do **not** have to include fall semester grades. Thus, transcripts may contain courses in progress. International academic records must be in the original language accompanied by an official English translation. Documents should be uploaded as part of the online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/). [If you are recommended for admission, the Gradaute School will request official transcripts.]

* A **Supplemental Application Form** is part of the online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/). It is important that you include all advanced mathematics courses you have completed, are currently enrolled in, or intend to take. For each course give the name of the school where you took it, the course number, the title, description, books used, and the grade you received (for completed courses). If you have more than 20 courses, please include ONLY the most advanced courses. We are looking for the course descriptions, and books used - this is not just a repeat of transcript information. Your transcript does not give us course descriptions and books used.

* A **statement of reasons** for graduate study. Submit this electronically with your online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/).

* **GRE** (Graduate Record Exam) scores, including the Subject test in mathematics. In exceptional cases, advanced GRE's from other sciences can be substituted for the advanced GRE in mathematics. December scores will be received online by mid-January. If you have taken the exam by December 15, this will not present a problem. If you take the exam after December, your scores will not reach us in time. You may submit your application without a GRE or Subject test score, but your application may be at a severe disadvantage. Have ETS (Educational Testing Service) electronically submit your scores, using our institution code of **1846**. (There is NO department code. It doesn't matter what department code you choose, the university's central database receives the scores. It is preferable you do not choose a dept code.)

* Three **letters** that address the question of mathematical promise. These letters should be from mathematics faculty, or other faculty familiar with the demands of graduate work in mathematics. Please note we do not require forms for letters of recommendation. Have your recommenders submit their letters electronically through your [online application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/).

* Applicants, whose native language is not English or whose undergraduate instruction was not in English, must provide official scores from the **TOEFL** (Test of English as a Foreign Language). See the [Graduate School’s website](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/requirements/) for exemptions from taking the TOEFL. Please have ETS electronically submit your scores, using our institution code of **1846**. (There is NO department code.)

For minimum scores related to the TOEFL Exam, click [here](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/requirements/). Competitive scores for the TOEFL are 630 (paper), 267 (computer), 109 or above.

* The Graduate School application fee is currently **75.00**, plus an additional **6.00** international document processing fee for non US citizens. The Mathematics Department is not able to waive these fees.

**International students please note**: if we offer admission and you accept it, we require international students attend a summer (early July to mid August) TA orientation/training program (prior to the start of the semester) and successfully complete the SPEAK test of spoken English (given on campus). This is a mandatory program. By accepting our offer of admission, you are obligated to be here for the program. Attendees are given some financial support during the summer orientation.

If you have any questions about the above requirements, please see the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page](http://www.math.wisc.edu/graduate/faqs).

* International student financial information will only be requested by the Graduate School after the departmental recommendation for admission. For information on International Student Expenses, please click [here](https://grad.wisc.edu/international-students/).

* Please check your ‘status check’ sheet online at MyUW to check to see if your materials have arrived. The status check will be available starting December 5. However, if materials were sent through the postal service, the online system will be updated as mail is processed. It could take a few weeks to process the mail. **Please Note**: You must submit your online application before anything can be noted on your status check page.

Decisions for acceptance to the program will not occur until March and we will contact you. If you have not heard from us, it is possible that we are still considering your application. We typically receive over 400 applications. Please refrain from contacting us to find out the status of your application. We can appreciate that you are anxious to hear about the admission decision, however, we have a limited amount of resources to respond to the email requests.

* Degree conferral, if applicable
* Do not mail hard copies until you have been admitted. 
 
After Admission Decision:
Upon provisional admission to UC San Diego, official transcripts from all institutions attended after high school will be required to finalize your admission and must be submitted to the Graduate Admissions office. Official records including transcripts, evaluations, mark sheets, diplomas, certificates, translations, and study abroad work.

Official transcripts must be delivered in a sealed envelope from the administering institution or service. Documents will not be accepted if opened or sealed by the student.

If your academic record cannot be replaced, obtain a properly certified copy. Submitted records become the property of the University, and we cannot return them to you. Certified electronic transcripts sent directly to Graduate Admissions from the issuing institution are also accepted. Electronic transcripts should be sent to gradadmissions@ucsd.edu.

Applicants with academic work in progress who expect to complete a degree program before the intended date of enrollment at UC San Diego, must provide evidence of degree conferral and a final academic transcript as soon as they are available.

#### Statement of Purpose
Focus your Statement of Purpose on the reasons you are interested in attending a specific graduate program at UCSD. Check the department requirements for the Statement of Purpose. The statement should be well organized, concise, and completely free of grammar, punctuation, and spelling errors. Before submitting the statement, seek constructive comments and criticism from friends and advisors.

Five primary topics to cover in your statement of purpose:

* How did you become interested in this field? Establish that you have had a long-term interest in the field and that you have taken positive steps in pursuing your interest. Give the committee members a sense of your particular talents and abilities and their relevance to your academic interests.

* What experiences have contributed toward your preparation for further study in this field? Demonstrate your interest by providing examples of research experiences, internships, work experience, community service, publications, or life experiences. Briefly describe what you did in each experience. Also, make sure to articulate what you have learned about the field and how those lessons stimulated you to pursue an advanced degree.

* What are your future goals? Specifically state your degree objective (Master's or Ph.D.) and specify what subdisciplines you are interested in pursuing. For example, if you are applying in political science, the committee needs to know whether you are pursuing American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, or Political Theory. Let the reader know that you are planning a future career as a university professor, researcher, or consultant, or in public service or private practice (or whatever your goal happens to be).

* What are your research interests? Within your subdiscipline, you should be able to identify one or two topics that are of interest to you. When possible, be specific about your research agenda. Remember that you will be working with professors in research; therefore, your research interests should parallel those of the faculty. (You will usually not be expected to know exactly what you want to research; faculty know that initial interests often change.)

* How are you a "match" for the program to which you are applying? Explain what attracts you most to the institution/program to which you are applying. Align your research interests with those of one or more of the affiliated professors. The better the "match" with the program/professors, the better the chance that you will be admitted.

Other factors to weave in (remember these are secondary factors):

* Give examples of personal attributes or qualities that would help you complete graduate study successfully.
Describe your determination to achieve your goals, your initiative and ability to develop ideas, and your ability to work independently.

* Describe background characteristics that may have placed you at an educational disadvantage (English language learner, family economic history, lack of educational opportunity, disability, etc.).

* Leave the reader believing that you are prepared for advanced academic work and will be successful in graduate school.

* [Graduate College](https://grad.illinois.edu/admissions/apply)

#### Deadline : Jan 4, 2019

### Online Application
First complete the [online](https://grad.illinois.edu/admissions/apply) portion of the application, including payment of the application fee.

#### GRE
The GRE general test and mathematics subject test are required for all applicants living in the United States or Canada (except applicants with a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). They are strongly recommended for all other applicants.

#### Transcripts
As part of the online application process you will be asked to upload a copy of your undergraduate transcript (and also graduate transcript if applicable) showing grades for the most recent semester. For example, applicants for Fall admission should submit a transcript showing grades for the preceding Fall.

#### Letters of Recommendation
Please arrange for three letters of recommendation to be uploaded to our online application system. Letters from professors who have taught you in mathematics classes or who have supervised you in a research project are the most useful.

#### Personal Statement
Please include a 1-2 page personal statement as part of your online application. We prefer statements that are honest, specific, and brief, and explain why you are applying to our program.

#### English Requirements for International Applicants
Students with high TOEFL or IELTS scores have a better chance of admission!

1. Minimum Requirement for Admission
All international applicants must satisfy the Graduate College English Proficiency Requirement for Admission.
The Mathematics Department requires a minimum TOEFL iBT speak score of 22 (or IELTS 6.5 speaking score) and a minimum TOEFL total of 95 for admission to the PhD program. Some applicants are exempt from the English requirement for admission. Even those students will increase their chance of admission if they submit recent TOEFL or IELTS scores.

2. Minimum Requirement for Teaching Assistantship Funding
Teaching assistants must meet a higher standard: proficiency in spoken English, as measured by the Internet Based TOEFL (iBT), the IELTS, the TSE (Test of Spoken English), or the university-administered EPI (English Proficiency Interview). Students who do not satisfy this requirement can still be granted a Teaching Assistantship in Mathematics with duties outside the classroom (e.g. grading) for the first two years, provided they enter with a TOEFL iBT speaking sub-section score of 22 or 23. After two years, continuation of the Teaching Assistantship depends on whether the student has successfully demonstrated proficiency in spoken English.

### Application Requirements
#### Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Scores
A good performance on the GRE Math Subject test helps to confirm knowledge of these topics, and we very strongly recommend that you take the GRE Math Subject test. We also recommend submitting GRE General test scores.

Our department does not require GRE scores for admission, but we strongly recommend taking the Math Subject GRE. Although the math subject GRE is only recommended (not required), the admissions committee is unlikely to admit international applicants without a submitted score.

Official GRE scores are sent by ETS and uploaded to you online application.

For GRE, the University of Minnesota's GRE institution code is **6874**, and the School of Mathematics' department code is **0703**.

#### TOEFL Scores
TOEFL scores are required for those who did not grow up speaking English as a native language in their home. More information about the TOEFL requirement.

#### Transcripts
**Unofficial** transcripts or academic records should be uploaded directly to the online application. Do not mail paper copies of your transcripts, there is no need for official transcripts or academic records for initial review.

If you are admitted, you must submit official transcripts or academic records before you enroll at the University of Minnesota.

#### Personal Statement of Purpose and Goals
is very important for us to assess your sincerity, motivation, and expectations.

Note: Other statements are not required, but will be considered if submitted.


For TOEFL, the University of Minnesota's TOEFL institution code is **6874**, and the School of Mathematics' department code is **72**.

#### List of Advanced Mathematics Courses
Besides the required information on The Graduate School's online application for admission, the School of Mathematics requires that you indicate the text for the advanced mathematics courses you have taken beyond the level of advanced calculus, linear algebra, and elementary courses in differential equations, etc. If you have done reading on your own, please indicate this as well. (Do NOT state: "refer to transcripts"). 

You should list the advanced mathematics courses you have taken. This means courses beyond the usual lower-division mathematics courses such as calculus, introductory differential equations, and introductory linear algebra. Specifically, for graduate work in mathematics it is important to have solid preparation in abstract algebra and analysis, no matter what your eventual specialty may be. It is expected that you will have had year-long courses in both abstract algebra and rigorous analysis. An application should have exceptional strength in other aspects if these expectations are not met. 

It is important that you list the texts used for your advanced courses, and which parts of them you covered. Many courses with the same name are nevertheless radically different from each other. Please do make clear the source and content of your courses. 

#### Letters of Recommendation
You should list the three people who will write your letters of recommendation. These letters are a very important part of your application, since they are used to estimate your potential and motivation for graduate work in mathematics. Usually these letters are from mathematicians with whom you've been involved in advanced coursework or research projects.

Only letters from those listed by the applicant on the application will be accepted. Letter writers should upload letters in pdf version to the online application system.

US News Rank: [Math][1] #39, [Analysis][2] #16, [Algebra][3] #12+, [Geometry][4] #14+

#### Application Deadline : Dec 15, 2018

### Application Information
The following items are required to apply to the Graduate Program of Mathematics:

* **Departmental Preapplication form** Only submit once. If you made an error in the departmental pre-application, do not submit it again. Notify our department and we will edit the departmental pre-application on our end.

* **ApplyTexas application**. Once the main Admissions Office receives the ApplyTexas application, they will send a notice to you with information about the UIN (university identification number) and how to use this number to access the AIS tracking system where you will upload your remaining items (personal statement, resume, transcripts, and test scores) and also track the status of your application materials. Please be aware that it usually takes the main Admissions Office 3-5 days to send the UIN notice after receipt of the ApplyTexas application. And during peak application periods (December-March), it can take up to 10 days or longer to send the UIN notice so you will need to take this into account when submitting your application. We ask that you do not enter in your Social Security Number in the ApplyTexas application.

* **Official transcripts** and **degree statements** from every senior-level institution of higher education attended (transcripts from community colleges are not required). For review purposes, you may upload unofficial copies of your transcripts into the AIS system. If your Social Security Number is printed on the transcript, you must black it out prior to uploading.
(For international applicants: transcripts must be in **native** language of the institution and also include an **official English translation**.)

* General and Math Subject **GRE** scores taken within 5 years of the date application was received (the GRE Subject score is only required for PhD applicants). The scores must be reported directly from ETS. Our institution code is 6003. A departmental code is not needed.

* If native language is not English: **TOEFL**, IELTS or PTE scores taken within the last 2 years of the date application was received (must be directly reported from their respective testing centers. Our institution code is 6003; the departmental code is not necessary). In order to be admitted, students must have achieved at least the following minimum required scores on the indicated tests: TOEFL: **80**; IELTS: 6.0; PTE: 53. Texas A&M will only waive the TOEFL/IELTS/PTE if the student scores at least 400 (old scale system) or 146 (new scale system) on the verbal portion of the general GRE OR if the student has completed a bachelor's degree with all years of attendance at a US institution (having just an MS from a US institution is not sufficient). International students supported on assistantships need to become certified for English proficiency within one year of enrollment. Students can become certified prior to enrollment by achieving any one of the following scores on the speaking sections of the indicated tests: TOEFL: **26 - 30**; IELTS: 8.0; PTE: 85. Students who are not certified prior to enrollment can obtain certification by scoring 80 or better on the English Language Proficiency Exam (ELPE), administered by Testing Services at Texas A&M University. (More information about the ELPE can be found at the web site https://testing.tamu.edu/Exams/ELPE.)

* **3 letters of recommendation**. There is an electronic Letter of Recommendation system (eLOR) accessed via AIS which is the preferred method for submission (paper letters submitted via regular mail take longer for Admissions to process). Applicants must enter in the email address and other information pertaining to their recommender into the eLOR system then click "send email" to notify their recommender that they are requesting a letter of reference. Recommendations should come from individuals who can attest to the applicant's mathematical abilities.

* **Application fee** (non-refundable): 65.00 for U.S. applicants, **90.00** for international applicants.
