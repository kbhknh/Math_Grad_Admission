## Harvard
US News Rank: [Math][1] #2(4 tied), [Analysis][2] #8(2 tied), [Algebra][3] #2, [Geometry][4] #1

* [Harvard Mathematics Department Admission Info](http://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/index.html#admission)

#### Application Deadline:  December 15, 2018

### Preparing the Application
The **statement of purpose** for graduate applications is carefully weighted by the admissions committee. The applicant's statement should convince the committee that he or she is able to communicate effectively and with a deep understanding of mathematics. It is not intended to be a biographical sketch or a reflection on one's decision to enter the field.

Three **letters of recommendation** are required. Letter writers should be faculty or others qualified to evaluate the applicant's potential for graduate study in mathematics. The letters must be submitted online and by the application deadline.

Applicants should include any **research papers, publications, and other original works** they would like to have evaluated by the admissions committee.

The department requires all applicants to submit **GRE Mathematics Subject Test** scores. Applicants should check on the ETS website for test dates in their area to insure the scores will be submitted before the application deadline. While the admissions committee reviews all applications submitted before the deadline, missing math subject test scores provide one less data point available to evaluate the application. Depending on the applicant pool and the strength of the application materials, the missing subject test scores may put the application at a disadvantage. 

The Graduate School requires scores to be submitted for the General Test of the Graduate Record Examinations (**GRE**).

Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold the equivalent of a US Bachelor degree from an institution at which English is the language of instruction must submit scores from the Internet Based Test (IBT) of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (**TOEFL**).

The Graduate School requires applicants to upload an electronic copy of undergraduate **transcripts**. Hard copies of official transcripts are not required at the time of application.

#### [Personal Statement](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/personal-statement/ "link")

* What does this statement need to accomplish?
	>The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community, giving the committee an image of you as a person.
	This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your understanding of the experiences of groups historically under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase participation by a diverse population in higher education.

* What kinds of content belongs here?
	>Anything that can give reviewers a sense of you as a person belongs here; you can repeat information about your experiences in your research statement, but any experiences that show your promise, initiative, and ability to persevere despite obstacles belongs here. This is also a good place to display your communication skills and discuss your ability to maximize effective collaboration with a diverse cross-section of the academic community. If you have faced any obstacles or barriers in your education, sharing those experiences serves both for the selection process, and for your nomination for fellowships. If one part of your academic record is not ideal, due to challenges you faced in that particular area, this is where you can explain that, and direct reviewers’ attention to the evidence of your promise for higher education.

* The basic message: your academic achievement despite challenges
	>It is especially helpful for admissions committees considering nominating you for fellowships for diversity if you discuss any or all of the following:

	* Demonstrated significant academic achievement by overcoming barriers such as economic, social, or educational disadvantage;
	* Potential to contribute to higher education through understanding the barriers facing women, domestic minorities, students with disabilities, and other members of groups underrepresented in higher education careers, as evidenced by life experiences and educational background. For example,,
		* attendance at a minority serving institution;
		* ability to articulate the barriers facing women and minorities in science and engineering fields;
		* participation in higher education pipeline programs such as, UC Leads, or McNair Scholars;
	* Academic service advancing equitable access to higher education for women and racial minorities in fields where they are underrepresented;
	* Leadership experience among students from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education;
	* Research interests focusing on underserved populations and understanding issues of racial or gender inequalities. For example,
		* research that addresses issues such as race, gender, diversity, and inclusion;
		* research that addresses health disparities, educational access and achievement, political engagement, economic justice, social mobility, civil and human rights, and other questions of interest to historically underrepresented groups;
		* artistic expression and cultural production that reflects culturally diverse communities or voices not well represented in the arts and humanities.

#### [Statement of Purpose](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/statement-purpose/ "link"): required??

* Part 1: Introduce yourself, your interests and motivations
	* Tell them what you’re interested in, and perhaps, what sparked your desire for graduate study. This should be short and to the point; don’t spend a great deal of time on autobiography.



* Part 2: Summarize your undergraduate and previous graduate career
	* Research you conducted. Indicate with whom, the title of the project, what your responsibilities were, and the outcome. Write technically, or in the style of your discipline. Professors are the people who read these statements.
	* Important paper or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your curricular requirements.
	* Work experience, especially if you had any kind of responsibility for testing, designing, researching or interning in an area similar to what you wish to study in graduate school.



* Part 3: Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities
	* If you graduated and worked prior to returning to grad school, indicate what you’ve been doing: company or non-profit, your work/design team, responsibilities, what you learned. You can also indicate here how this helped you focus your graduate studies.
	

* Part 4: Elaborate on your academic interests
	* Here you indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in their discipline, and are engaged with current research themes.
		* Indicate the area of your interests. Ideally, pose a question, define a problem, or indicate a theme that you would like to address, and questions that arise from contemporary research. This should be an ample paragraph!
		* Look on the web for information about departments you’re interested in, including professors and their research. Are there professors whose research interests parallel yours? If so, indicate this. Check the specific program; many may require you to name a professor or professors with whom you might work.
		* End your statement in a positive manner, indicating your excitement and readiness for the challenges ahead of you.
		

* Essential Tips
	* What the admissions committee will read between the lines: self-motivation, competence, potential as a graduate student.
	* Emphasize everything from a positive perspective and write in an active, not a passive voice.
	* Demonstrate everything by example; don’t say directly that you’re a persistent person, show it.
	* If there is something important that happened to you that affected your grades, such as poverty, illness, or excessive work, state it. Write it affirmatively, showing your perseverance despite obstacles. You can elaborate more in your personal statement.
	* Make sure everything is linked with continuity and focus.
	* Unless the specific program says otherwise, be concise; an ideal essay should say everything it needs to with brevity. Approximately 500 to 1000 well-selected words (1-2 single space pages in 12 point font) is better than more words with less clarity and poor organization.

* [online application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/)

### Admission Requirements
Typically we expect:

* A GPA of at least 3.0 overall and substantially higher in mathematics courses.
* 18 or more credits of mathematics beyond calculus. The 18 credits should include at least one semester of both rigorous analysis (sometimes called advanced calculus) and abstract algebra, and preferably two semesters. Advanced undergraduate courses in other topics further strengthen your application.
* Transcripts or academic records from each institution attended. Transcripts do not have to include fall semester grades. Thus, transcripts may contain courses in progress. International academic records must be in the original language accompanied by an official English translation. Documents should be uploaded as part of the online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/). [If you are recommended for admission, the Gradaute School will request official transcripts.]
* A “Supplemental Application Form” is part of the online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/). It is important that you include all advanced mathematics courses you have completed, are currently enrolled in, or intend to take. For each course give the name of the school where you took it, the course number, the title, description, books used, and the grade you received (for completed courses). If you have more than 20 courses, please include ONLY the most advanced courses. We are looking for the course descriptions, and books used - this is not just a repeat of transcript information. Your transcript does not give us course descriptions and books used.
* A statement of reasons for graduate study. Submit this electronically with your online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/).
* GRE (Graduate Record Exam) scores, including the Subject test in mathematics. In exceptional cases, advanced GRE's from other sciences can be substituted for the advanced GRE in mathematics. December scores will be received online by mid-January. If you have taken the exam by December 15, this will not present a problem. If you take the exam after December, your scores will not reach us in time. You may submit your application without a GRE or Subject test score, but your application may be at a severe disadvantage. Have ETS (Educational Testing Service) electronically submit your scores, using our institution code of **1846**. (There is NO department code. It doesn't matter what department code you choose, the university's central database receives the scores. It is preferable you do not choose a dept code.)
* Three letters that address the question of mathematical promise. These letters should be from mathematics faculty, or other faculty familiar with the demands of graduate work in mathematics. Please note we do not require forms for letters of recommendation. Have your recommenders submit their letters electronically through your [online application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/).
* Applicants, whose native language is not English or whose undergraduate instruction was not in English, must provide official scores from the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). See the [Graduate School’s website](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/requirements/) for exemptions from taking the TOEFL. Please have ETS electronically submit your scores, using our institution code of **1846**. (There is NO department code.)
For minimum scores related to the TOEFL Exam, click [here](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/requirements/). Competitive scores for the TOEFL are 630 (paper), 267 (computer), 109 or above.
* The Graduate School application fee is currently **75.00**, plus an additional **6.00** international document processing fee for non US citizens. The Mathematics Department is not able to waive these fees.

**International students please note**: if we offer admission and you accept it, we require international students attend a summer (early July to mid August) TA orientation/training program (prior to the start of the semester) and successfully complete the SPEAK test of spoken English (given on campus). This is a mandatory program. By accepting our offer of admission, you are obligated to be here for the program. Attendees are given some financial support during the summer orientation.

If you have any questions about the above requirements, please see the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page](http://www.math.wisc.edu/graduate/faqs).

* International student financial information will only be requested by the Graduate School after the departmental recommendation for admission. For information on International Student Expenses, please click [here](https://grad.wisc.edu/international-students/).
* Please check your ‘status check’ sheet online at MyUW to check to see if your materials have arrived. The status check will be available starting December 5. However, if materials were sent through the postal service, the online system will be updated as mail is processed. It could take a few weeks to process the mail. **Please Note**: You must submit your online application before anything can be noted on your status check page.

Decisions for acceptance to the program will not occur until March and we will contact you. If you have not heard from us, it is possible that we are still considering your application. We typically receive over 400 applications. Please refrain from contacting us to find out the status of your application. We can appreciate that you are anxious to hear about the admission decision, however, we have a limited amount of resources to respond to the email requests.
