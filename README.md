## Harvard
US News Rank: [Math][1] #2(4 tied), [Analysis][2] #8(2 tied), [Algebra][3] #2, [Geometry][4] #1

* [Harvard Mathematics Department Admission Info](http://www.math.harvard.edu/graduate/index.html#admission)

#### Application Deadline:  December 15, 2018

### Preparing the Application
The **statement of purpose** for graduate applications is carefully weighted by the admissions committee. The applicant's statement should convince the committee that he or she is able to communicate effectively and with a deep understanding of mathematics. It is not intended to be a biographical sketch or a reflection on one's decision to enter the field.

Three **letters of recommendation** are required. Letter writers should be faculty or others qualified to evaluate the applicant's potential for graduate study in mathematics. The letters must be submitted online and by the application deadline.

Applicants should include any **research papers, publications, and other original works** they would like to have evaluated by the admissions committee.

The department requires all applicants to submit **GRE Mathematics Subject Test** scores. Applicants should check on the ETS website for test dates in their area to insure the scores will be submitted before the application deadline. While the admissions committee reviews all applications submitted before the deadline, missing math subject test scores provide one less data point available to evaluate the application. Depending on the applicant pool and the strength of the application materials, the missing subject test scores may put the application at a disadvantage. 

The Graduate School requires scores to be submitted for the General Test of the Graduate Record Examinations (**GRE**).

Applicants whose native language is other than English and who do not hold the equivalent of a US Bachelor degree from an institution at which English is the language of instruction must submit scores from the Internet Based Test (IBT) of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (**TOEFL**).

The Graduate School requires applicants to upload an electronic copy of undergraduate **transcripts**. Hard copies of official transcripts are not required at the time of application.

#### Personal Statement

_The Personal History Statement is required from all applicants. Please note that the Personal History Statement should not duplicate the Statement of Purpose._

Please describe how your personal background and experiences influenced your decision to pursue a graduate degree. In this section, you may also include any relevant information on the following:
* How you have overcome barriers to access higher education
* How you have come to understand the barriers faced by others
* Your academic service to advance equitable access to higher education for women, racial minorities and individuals from other groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education
* Your research focusing on under served populations or related issues of inequality
* Your leadership among such groups
  
[Admission info site Help:](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/personal-statement/ "link")

* What does this statement need to accomplish?
	>The personal statement should give concrete evidence of your promise as a member of the academic community, giving the committee an image of you as a person.
	This is also where you represent your potential to bring to your academic career a critical perspective rooted in a non-traditional educational background, or your understanding of the experiences of groups historically under-represented in higher education and your commitment to increase participation by a diverse population in higher education.

* What kinds of content belongs here?
	>Anything that can give reviewers a sense of you as a person belongs here; you can repeat information about your experiences in your research statement, but any experiences that show your promise, initiative, and ability to persevere despite obstacles belongs here. This is also a good place to display your communication skills and discuss your ability to maximize effective collaboration with a diverse cross-section of the academic community. If you have faced any obstacles or barriers in your education, sharing those experiences serves both for the selection process, and for your nomination for fellowships. If one part of your academic record is not ideal, due to challenges you faced in that particular area, this is where you can explain that, and direct reviewers’ attention to the evidence of your promise for higher education.

* The basic message: your academic achievement despite challenges
	>It is especially helpful for admissions committees considering nominating you for fellowships for diversity if you discuss any or all of the following:

	* Demonstrated significant academic achievement by overcoming barriers such as economic, social, or educational disadvantage;
	* Potential to contribute to higher education through understanding the barriers facing women, domestic minorities, students with disabilities, and other members of groups underrepresented in higher education careers, as evidenced by life experiences and educational background. For example,,
		* attendance at a minority serving institution;
		* ability to articulate the barriers facing women and minorities in science and engineering fields;
		* participation in higher education pipeline programs such as, UC Leads, or McNair Scholars;
	* Academic service advancing equitable access to higher education for women and racial minorities in fields where they are underrepresented;
	* Leadership experience among students from groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education;
	* Research interests focusing on underserved populations and understanding issues of racial or gender inequalities. For example,
		* research that addresses issues such as race, gender, diversity, and inclusion;
		* research that addresses health disparities, educational access and achievement, political engagement, economic justice, social mobility, civil and human rights, and other questions of interest to historically underrepresented groups;
		* artistic expression and cultural production that reflects culturally diverse communities or voices not well represented in the arts and humanities.

#### [Statement of Purpose](https://grad.berkeley.edu/admissions/apply/statement-purpose/ "link")

_Please describe your aptitude and motivation for graduate study in your area of specialization, including your preparation for this field of study, your academic plans or research interests, and your future career goals. Please be specific about why UC Berkeley would be a good intellectual fit for you._


* Part 1: Introduce yourself, your interests and motivations
	* Tell them what you’re interested in, and perhaps, what sparked your desire for graduate study. This should be short and to the point; don’t spend a great deal of time on autobiography.



* Part 2: Summarize your undergraduate and previous graduate career
	* Research you conducted. Indicate with whom, the title of the project, what your responsibilities were, and the outcome. Write technically, or in the style of your discipline. Professors are the people who read these statements.
	* Important paper or thesis project you completed, as well as anything scholarly beyond your curricular requirements.
	* Work experience, especially if you had any kind of responsibility for testing, designing, researching or interning in an area similar to what you wish to study in graduate school.



* Part 3: Discuss the relevance of your recent and current activities
	* If you graduated and worked prior to returning to grad school, indicate what you’ve been doing: company or non-profit, your work/design team, responsibilities, what you learned. You can also indicate here how this helped you focus your graduate studies.
	

* Part 4: Elaborate on your academic interests
	* Here you indicate what you would like to study in graduate school in enough detail to convince the faculty that you understand the scope of research in their discipline, and are engaged with current research themes.
		* Indicate the area of your interests. Ideally, pose a question, define a problem, or indicate a theme that you would like to address, and questions that arise from contemporary research. This should be an ample paragraph!
		* Look on the web for information about departments you’re interested in, including professors and their research. Are there professors whose research interests parallel yours? If so, indicate this. Check the specific program; many may require you to name a professor or professors with whom you might work.
		* End your statement in a positive manner, indicating your excitement and readiness for the challenges ahead of you.
		

* Essential Tips
	* What the admissions committee will read between the lines: self-motivation, competence, potential as a graduate student.
	* Emphasize everything from a positive perspective and write in an active, not a passive voice.
	* Demonstrate everything by example; don’t say directly that you’re a persistent person, show it.
	* If there is something important that happened to you that affected your grades, such as poverty, illness, or excessive work, state it. Write it affirmatively, showing your perseverance despite obstacles. You can elaborate more in your personal statement.
	* Make sure everything is linked with continuity and focus.
	* Unless the specific program says otherwise, be concise; an ideal essay should say everything it needs to with brevity. Approximately 500 to 1000 well-selected words (1-2 single space pages in 12 point font) is better than more words with less clarity and poor organization.

### General Information(Mathematics)
Applicants should have a good background in undergraduate mathematics, regardless of their majors. They should submit GRE scores (General Test and Subject Test in mathematics). International students whose native language is not English must submit TOEFL scores. However, if the student received their degree in the United States, they do not have to take the TOEFL.  Students who have a background in advanced mathematics will find our program quite flexible. Visits to Brown and direct communication with the graduate representative are strongly encouraged. The deadline for our receipt of application material and letters of recommendation is January 1, 2018. Admission and financial aid awards are usually announced by the middle of March.

Use the online application to apply. The online application offers tools for collecting and submitting some, but not all, of the documents and information required for application. Departments may require additional information, so please check their listings. In general, though, applicants are responsible for submitting the following: 

#### Personal Statement 
All applicants are required to submit a personal statement regarding their interests and/or intended areas of study. Some programs ask applicants to address specific questions in their personal statements. Please review the listings for the Ph.D. or master’s program in which you are interested for details. 

#### Transcripts 
We strongly encourage applicants to submit a scanned image of the transcript at the time of application, which can speed processing; however, a final, official transcript will be required of all admitted students who matriculate. Applicants who have attended international institutions must submit transcripts or certified attestations of study, with certified English translations. Once translated, the original transcript and the certified translations are to be sent to the Graduate School admission office. College seniors should submit current transcripts, followed by a final official transcript showing the award of the baccalaureate degree prior to matriculation, as is required and mentioned above. 

#### Letters of Recommendation 
The Graduate School requires **three** letters of recommendation by persons well qualified to speak from first-hand knowledge about the applicant's potential for graduate study. All letters should comment on an applicant’s ability to do research and perform in the program’s required coursework. At least two of these letters should be from faculty at the institution of current study or, if the applicant is not in school at the time of application, at the institution most recently attended. Letters of recommendation for applicants to master’s programs may be from academic or non-academic sources; please consult individual program listings for details. Letters of recommendation must be submitted online. If you are using Interfolio please refer to their website for instructions on submitting your recommendations electronically.

#### GRE 
Applicants to doctoral programs must have their results from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test sent to the Graduate School or, if applying to one of the programs in the School of Public Health, to a separate Brown University code. Please check program requirements regarding subject tests or supplementary materials. Please refer to our [GRE page](https://www.brown.edu/academics/gradschool/application-information/gre-information) and individual listings for the Ph.D. or master’s program in which you are interested for details. 

#### TOEFL/IELTS 
All international applicants whose native language is not English must ensure that the Graduate School receives their official score from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or International English Language Testing System (IELTS).

Regarding TOEFL, the recommended minimum score for admission consideration is 577 on the paper-based test and **90** on the Internet-based test. For IELTS, the recommended minimum overall band score is 7. Some programs may have more rigorous language proficiency standards; applicants with questions should contact programs directly. These exams should be taken early enough to allow the scores to reach the Graduate School by your program's deadline. Performance on the tests is one of many factors considered in making admission decisions. 

Official TOEFL scores should be sent to Brown University Graduate School (reporting code **3094**). Those applying to School of Public Health programs should have the scores sent to both the Graduate School and SOPHAS (reporting code  5688).

Students who have been awarded teaching assistantships and whose native language is not English will be tested upon their arrival for English proficiency before they begin teaching. If a student's English language skills do not meet the minimum standards of certification, provisional approval of the appointment may be made on the condition that the student enroll in an English-language training course during the first semester of the appointment and be assigned to other duties that will prepare them for teaching. 

NOTE: Students who have not been certified at the appropriate level for the classroom or laboratory will not be supported as teaching assistants past the first year.

#### Application Fee and Waivers
A non-refundable fee of $75 is charged for processing each application received by the Graduate School. This fee must be paid when the application is submitted. An application will not be processed unless the fee is paid. Applicants who want to be evaluated by more than one graduate program must submit separate applications to each program for which they would like to be considered. The Graduate School is not responsible for errors made by applicants during the application process. There are no application-fee refunds. Application-fee waivers are available under certain circumstances. Applicants to Brown's graduate programs who are U.S. citizens or permanent residents and can demonstrate financial need may apply for an application-fee waiver. Please note: application-fee waivers are not available for international applicants. Please see this page for detailed information about application-fee waivers.

#### Paper Credentials and Other Documentation
All materials related to an application that are not submitted electronically as part of the online application should be mailed to the Graduate School admission office: 47 George St., Box 1867, Brown University, Providence, R.I. 02912. Do not send any application materials directly to the program you are applying to as this will only slow the progress of your application. Material submitted in support of the application, including transcripts and writing samples, will not be returned to the applicant. 

#### Criteria for Admission
Admission to the Graduate School is determined at the program level with oversight by the Graduate School. Each program, in consultation with the dean of the Graduate School, sets its own admission criteria. The individual academic programs evaluate applications for admission. Admission decisions are made after a full review of the materials in the application. Programs consider previous records, test scores, and recommendations and look for clear evidence of the ability to do advanced work of the highest quality. The admission decisions are final. There is no appeals process.

#### Notification
Applicants should expect to be notified within four to eight weeks of the application deadline for their programs (February or March for a January 1 deadline). Whether or not applications that are submitted after a program's stated deadline will be reviewed is at the discretion of each program. While individual academic programs evaluate applicants for admission, offers of admission are only binding when made in writing by the Dean of the Graduate School. Admission may, in some cases, be deferred; aid offers cannot be deferred.

The 18 credits should include at least one semester of both rigorous analysis (sometimes called advanced calculus) and abstract algebra, and preferably two semesters. Advanced undergraduate courses in other topics further strengthen your application.
* Transcripts or academic records from each institution attended. Transcripts do not have to include fall semester grades. Thus, transcripts may contain courses in progress. International academic records must be in the original language accompanied by an official English translation. Documents should be uploaded as part of the online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/). [If you are recommended for admission, the Gradaute School will request official transcripts.]
* A “Supplemental Application Form” is part of the online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/). It is important that you include all advanced mathematics courses you have completed, are currently enrolled in, or intend to take. For each course give the name of the school where you took it, the course number, the title, description, books used, and the grade you received (for completed courses). If you have more than 20 courses, please include ONLY the most advanced courses. We are looking for the course descriptions, and books used - this is not just a repeat of transcript information. Your transcript does not give us course descriptions and books used.
* A statement of reasons for graduate study. Submit this electronically with your online Graduate School [application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/).
* GRE (Graduate Record Exam) scores, including the Subject test in mathematics. In exceptional cases, advanced GRE's from other sciences can be substituted for the advanced GRE in mathematics. December scores will be received online by mid-January. If you have taken the exam by December 15, this will not present a problem. If you take the exam after December, your scores will not reach us in time. You may submit your application without a GRE or Subject test score, but your application may be at a severe disadvantage. Have ETS (Educational Testing Service) electronically submit your scores, using our institution code of **1846**. (There is NO department code. It doesn't matter what department code you choose, the university's central database receives the scores. It is preferable you do not choose a dept code.)
* Three letters that address the question of mathematical promise. These letters should be from mathematics faculty, or other faculty familiar with the demands of graduate work in mathematics. Please note we do not require forms for letters of recommendation. Have your recommenders submit their letters electronically through your [online application](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/).
* Applicants, whose native language is not English or whose undergraduate instruction was not in English, must provide official scores from the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language). See the [Graduate School’s website](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/requirements/) for exemptions from taking the TOEFL. Please have ETS electronically submit your scores, using our institution code of **1846**. (There is NO department code.)
For minimum scores related to the TOEFL Exam, click [here](https://grad.wisc.edu/apply/requirements/). Competitive scores for the TOEFL are 630 (paper), 267 (computer), 109 or above.
* The Graduate School application fee is currently **75.00**, plus an additional **6.00** international document processing fee for non US citizens. The Mathematics Department is not able to waive these fees.

**International students please note**: if we offer admission and you accept it, we require international students attend a summer (early July to mid August) TA orientation/training program (prior to the start of the semester) and successfully complete the SPEAK test of spoken English (given on campus). This is a mandatory program. By accepting our offer of admission, you are obligated to be here for the program. Attendees are given some financial support during the summer orientation.

If you have any questions about the above requirements, please see the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page](http://www.math.wisc.edu/graduate/faqs).

* International student financial information will only be requested by the Graduate School after the departmental recommendation for admission. For information on International Student Expenses, please click [here](https://grad.wisc.edu/international-students/).
* Please check your ‘status check’ sheet online at MyUW to check to see if your materials have arrived. The status check will be available starting December 5. However, if materials were sent through the postal service, the online system will be updated as mail is processed. It could take a few weeks to process the mail. **Please Note**: You must submit your online application before anything can be noted on your status check page.

Decisions for acceptance to the program will not occur until March and we will contact you. If you have not heard from us, it is possible that we are still considering your application. We typically receive over 400 applications. Please refrain from contacting us to find out the status of your application. We can appreciate that you are anxious to hear about the admission decision, however, we have a limited amount of resources to respond to the email requests.
